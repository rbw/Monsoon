Monsoon: WebSocket & RESTful HTTP API
---

Monsoon provides a WebSocket and RESTful HTTP API layer on top of Livestatus (Nagios, Naemon etc).
It's built on top of the Aioli framework and offers blazing-fast performance. Furthermore, it can
be easily imported and added to your own Aioli-based application.
